OSU's Assistant Professor Bo Sun was the PI for my undergraduate thesis, for which I wrote Matlab code to automatically mask user-selected cells in each frame of a movie to objectively  measure each cell's size and shape throughout the movie. I used python to visualize the measured data.

To Whom it May Concern,
I have enjoyed two years' formal education building, troubleshooting, and interfacing systems of analog and digital electronics. I also have several years' experience writing and typesetting publication-quality technical documents in LaTeX. This experience came through writing my homework solutions, my lab reports, and my undergraduate thesis. To sell myself, I'll mention my thesis used Matlab code I wrote for image-analysis, namely segmentation, in order to track and measure each user-selected cell's size and shape.

My drive to innovate and optimize as well as my enthusiasm for working with technology make me valuable to any employer. My hope is to become valuable to an employer through a position in research. Interview me and I may realize that hope.

Signed,
Kyle Thomas
